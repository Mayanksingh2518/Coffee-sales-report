# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis and Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a comprehensive sales dashboard for a coffee shop chain using Power BI. The dashboard provides valuable insights into sales trends, product performance, and store efficiency. The project integrates advanced Power BI features with SQL for data extraction and analysis, ensuring accurate and actionable insights.

## Key Features

### 1. **Power BI Dashboard**
- **Tooltips and Placeholders:** Implemented tooltips for context-sensitive information and placeholders for dynamic content, enhancing the user experience.
- **DAX Measures and Columns:** Utilized Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns and measures for dynamic insights and calculations.
- **Calendar Table:** Created a custom calendar table to handle date-related analysis, allowing for more accurate time-based reporting.

### 2. **Data Analysis**
- **SQL Integration:** SQL was used extensively for data extraction and transformation. This includes filtering, aggregating, and joining tables to prepare the data for visualization in Power BI.

## Project Structure

- **/data/**: Contains the raw data files and SQL scripts used for data extraction and transformation.
- **/dashboard/**: Includes the Power BI (.pbix) file with the completed dashboard.
- **/scripts/**: DAX formulas, calculated columns, and any custom scripts used in the project.
- **/documentation/**: Project documentation, including this README file, explanations of the dashboard features, and user instructions.
